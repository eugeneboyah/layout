	<h1>FLEX BOX SUMMARY</h1>

	<h3>What is flexbox?</h3>
	<p>Flexbox is a layout mechanism designed for laying out groups of items in one dimension. Learn how to use it in this module. A design pattern that can be tricky in responsive design is a sidebar that sits inline with some content. Where there is viewport space, this pattern works great, but where space is condensed, that rigid layout can become problematic.
	</p>

<h3>What can you do with a flex layout?</h3>
<h4>Flex layouts have the following features:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>They can display as a row, or a column.</li>
	<li>They can display as a row, or a column.</li>
	<li>They are single line by default, but can be asked to wrap onto multiple lines.
</li>
	<li>Items in the layout can be visually reordered, away from their order in the DOM.
</li>
	<li>Space can be distributed inside the items, so they become bigger and smaller according to the space available in their parent.
</li>
	<li>Space can be distributed around the items and flex lines in a wrapped layout, using the Box Alignment properties.
</li>
	<li>The items themselves can be aligned on the cross axis.
</li>

</ul>

<h3>The main axis and the cross axis</h3>
<p>The key to understanding flexbox is to understand the concept of a main axis and a cross axis. The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column.
Flex items move as a group on the main axis. Remember: we've got a bunch of things and we are trying to get the best layout for them as a group.The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.</p>

<h3>Writing modes and direction</h3>
<p>Flex items lay out as a row by default. A row runs in the direction that sentences flow in your writing mode and script direction. Therefore the way flex items behave by default is linked to the writing mode of the document.</p>

<h3>Creating a flex container</h3>
<p>To use flexbox you need to declare that you want to use a flex formatting context and not regular block and inline layout. Do this by changing the value of the display property to flex.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Wrapping flex items</h3>
<p>The initial value of the flex-wrap property is nowrap. This means that if there is not enough space in the container the items will overflow.Items displaying using the initial values will shrink as small as they can, down to the min-content size before overflow happens.
When a flex container wraps it creates multiple flex lines. In terms of space distribution, each line acts like a new flex container. Therefore if you are wrapping rows, it is not possible to get something in row 2 to line up with something above it in row 1. This is what is meant by flexbox being one-dimensional. You can control alignment in one axis, a row or a column, not both together as we can do in grid.</p>

<h3>Initial Values</h3>
<p>All CSS properties have initial values which control how they behave "out of the box" when you haven't applied any CSS to change that initial behavior. The children of our flex container become flex items as soon as their parent gets display: flex, so these initial values mean that we start seeing some flexbox behavior. Intial value means that:</p>
