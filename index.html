	<h1>A brief history of Layout</h1>
	<p>in the early day og the web, design more complex tIn the early days of the web, designs more complex than a simple document were laid out with 'table' elements. Separating HTML from visual styles was made easier when CSS was widely adopted by browsers in the late '90s. CSS opened the door to developers being able to completely change the look and feel of a website without ever touching HTML. This new capability inspired projects such as The CSS Zen Garden, which was created to demonstrate the power of CSS to encourage more developers to learn it. CSS has evolved as our needs for web design and browser technology have evolved. You can read how CSS layout and our approach to layout has evolved over time in this article by Rachel Andrew.

	<h3>Understanding the display property</h3>
	<p>The display property does two things. And the two things are: 1) It determine if the box it is applied to acts as inline or block. and 2) The display property also determines how an element's children should behave.</p>
</div>
<div class="center">
	<h3>Flexbox and Grid</h3>
	<p>There are two main layout mechanisms that create layout rules for multiple elements, flexbox and grid. They share similarities, but are designed to solve different layout problems.</p>

	<h3>Flexbox</h3>
	<p>Flexbox is a layout mechanism for one-dimensional layouts. Layout across a single axis, either horizontally or vertically. By default, flexbox will align the element's children next to each other, in the inline direction, and stretch them in the block direction, so they're all the same height. Flexbox also converts the child elements to be flex items, which means you can write rules on how they behave inside a flex container. The flex property is a shorthand for "flex-grow", "flex-shrink" and "flex-basis".</p>

	<h3>Grid</h3>
	<p>Grid is similar in a lot of ways to flexbox, but it is designed to control multi-axis layouts instead of single-axis layouts (vertical or horizontal space).
Grid enables you to write layout rules on an element that has display: grid, and introduces a few new primitives for layout styling, such as the repeat() and minmax() functions. One useful grid unit is the fr unitâ€”which is a fraction of remaining space.

</p>

	<h3>layout</h3>
	<p>If not using grid or flexbox, your elements display in normal flow. There are a number of layout methods that you can use to adjust the behavior and position of items when in normal flow.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h3>Inline block</h3>
	<p>Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.

Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.</p>

<h3>Floats</h3>
<p>The float property instructs an element to "float" to the direction specified. The image in this example is instructed to float left, which then allows sibling elements to "wrap" around it. You can instruct an element to float left, right or inherit.</p>

<h3>Multicolumn layout</h3>
<p>If you have a really long list of elements, such as a list of all of the countries of the world, it can result in a lot of scrolling and time wasted for a user. It can also create excess whitespace on the page. With CSS multicolumn, you can split this into multiple columns to help with both of these issues.
